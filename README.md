# Quatnum flask

This is just a little program hosting a webserver (programmed with flask + python) that can be used for demonstrational purposes, when showing of the basic principles of quantum computers.

It uses [qiskit](https://qiskit.org) as the backend for the quantum simulator. Theorettically it's abel to run the code on real quantum computers.

Just run it, reach it at the address. Runs best in an App Platform like DigitalOceans.
