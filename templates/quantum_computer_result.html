        <p>We had to run this experiment a couple of times to correct for errors in the computer, but let's take a look at the results, shall we.</p>
        <p>The bar with "0" marks the times were the computer won, the bar with "1" marks the times you won.
            Maybe you actually managed to win against the computer a couple of times, but this had nothing to do with your skills,
            it only shows the few times this machine actually made errors. On the perfect quantum computer you would have lost all the times.

        <p>Below you can find a picture of the quantum circuit we used to conduct this experiment:</p>

        <p>This may seem like cheating, but it's really not and I want to explain why.</p>
